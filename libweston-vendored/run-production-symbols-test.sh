# Headless CI gate for the SHIPPED vendored libweston.
#
# The production profile of build-libweston.sh is what qdistro packages
# (see qdwin/doc/decisions/0001-vendored-libweston-packaging.md). This
# gate proves that profile actually exports the four soft-linked helper
# symbols qdwin resolves via dlsym — i.e. the packaged library can drive
# the layer-shell popup / grab paths. Stock libweston-14 exports none of
# them, so this is the discriminator between a shippable tree and a
# decorative one.
#
# It also runs the install-staging dry-run so a broken stage script is
# caught in CI rather than at image-build time. No VM, no display.
#
# Exit 0 only if all four symbols are exported AND the staging dry-run
# lays down the core + drm backend.

# (they live in their own backend .so files; the four soft-linked popup
# helpers are in the libweston-desktop core and need none of them). The
# VM/image build uses the full set (install-deps.sh covers it).
#
# Rather than hardcode these ON (which hard-fails the gate on a host that
# lacks e.g. GLES3/gl3.h, before the symbol assertion is ever reached),
# auto-detect each orthogonal backend's devel dependency and disable ONLY
# the ones whose dep is MISSING. An explicit QDWIN_LW_* override from the

# does NOT need GLES3, so it stays enabled.
