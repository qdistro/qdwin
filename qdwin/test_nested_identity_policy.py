"""Static-invariant checks for qdwin nested-proxy identity hardening.

These are negative-by-construction source checks (same style as
test_xdg_activation_policy.py): they parse qdwin.c and assert that the
nested-proxy paths bind client-asserted identity (origin_uid, input_sink,
bind_proxy_pixels) to the kernel/peer-resolved identity of the advertising
client rather than trusting the client's word.

The live multi-uid spoof scenarios (a client of uid B actually advertising
origin_uid=A, or connecting an input_sink owned by another uid) require a
running compositor with two uids and are exercised by the VM-only probe
host scenario; here we lock the enforcement in place so a regression that
drops a check fails the host test suite without a VM.

def check_bind_proxy_pixels_preserves_pending_gate(source):
    """F6#2 mechanism A (stash-and-defer): while a nested proxy is still
    PENDING the admin broker decision, bind_proxy_pixels must NOT make the
    client pixel surface input-routable. A client pixel surface has a
    default-FULL input region, so creating ANY view for it (even below the
    input-transparent background curtain) would let weston_compositor_pick_view
    route pointer input to an UNAPPROVED proxy. The current (commit 55620bc)
    design therefore stashes the surface with NO view created — it sets
    tl->proxy_pixel_surface = ws and returns early — and defers the real
    curtain->pixel swap to qdwin_nested_proxy_activate_pixel_surface() on allow.

    This used to be enforced by parking a pending view on held_layer via a
    `pending ? &held_layer.view_list : &normal_layer.view_list` ternary; that
    older shape was *input-routable* and was replaced by the strictly safer
    stash-and-defer. We re-lock the CURRENT invariant: the pending branch
    consults the broker gate, stashes the surface, returns early, and creates
    NO view / does no layer placement while pending. A regression that
    reintroduced a view-on-any-layer (held or normal) for a pending proxy would
    fail this check.

    Two ordering clauses strengthen this against a "pickable before/after the
    gate" regression that leaves the pending *block* itself clean:
      - clause (b) requires the pending block to END with an unconditional
        `return;` (and forbids `goto`), so the pending path PROVABLY exits at
        the gate and can never fall through (conditional return) or jump (goto)
        to the view-creating swap that follows the block. This is also why a
        SECOND `if (tl->nested_proxy_pending_decision) { ...create... }` placed
        after the first block is not a hole: the first block has already
        returned for the pending case, so that later branch is dead code for a
        pending proxy (only reached on the !pending fall-through).
      - clause (e) scans the function PREFIX up to and including the pending
        block and rejects the libweston view create/place/map *primitives*
        (weston_view_create / _move_to_layer / _set_position[_with_offset] /
        weston_surface_map[_with_input]) before the gate, excepting the
        teardown/read ops that can never make a NEW surface pickable
        (weston_view_destroy, weston_view_get_pos_offset_global).

    Residual, by design: this is a source-SHAPE invariant, not an
    interprocedural C analyzer. It catches the direct libweston create/place/
    map primitives before or inside the pending gate, and (via clause (b))
    proves the pending path cannot reach the post-gate direct primitives. It
    does NOT catch a pre-gate helper or object/function-like macro whose BODY
    hides such a primitive (e.g. `qdwin_prepare_pixels(tl, ws);` before the
    gate, or a `QDWIN_CREATE(ws)` alias) — such a wrapper runs before the gate
    and CAN create/place the pending pixel view. That limitation is accepted
    for consistency with the rest of this token-lock test suite (every check
    here locks a source shape, not the absence of behaviour hidden behind an
    arbitrary wrapper in another function); growing this into a whole-file
    macro scanner + blanket prefix call-allowlist would worsen false positives
    on safe refactors (helperized validation, an `if (!pending) {create;return;}`
    approved-first shape) while still only approximating C semantics. The load-
    bearing signals are the positive shape (stash + unconditional return + no
    view/list in the block) plus the direct-primitive bans."""
