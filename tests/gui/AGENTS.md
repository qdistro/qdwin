# qdwin GUI test runner — for graphic-aware subagents

This is the qdwin-on-tty3 sibling of `phase1/gui-tests/AGENTS.md`. The
older guide assumes labwc + XWayland (Phase 1-5 demo); qdwin runs on
bare DRM via libweston with no XWayland in this profile, so the input
and observation primitives are different.

## Roles

- **Orchestrator** — picks scenarios from `qdwin/NN-*.md`, spawns one
  runner per scenario, aggregates PASS/FAIL.
- **Runner** — graphic-aware subagent given a single scenario file +
  a target VM. Executes setup → steps → asserts and returns a report.

## Environment

- Host: openSUSE Tumbleweed with `libvirt` + `virsh`.
- Target: a running libvirt domain on `qemu:///session` running the
  qdwin compositor (greetd-qdwin.service active on tty3 with autologin
  as `admin`). Standard test password: `Pa_ssw0rd45`.
- VM name: `$VMNAME` if set, else `virsh list --name --state-running | head -1`.
- The qdshell ctrl-socket at `/run/user/1000/qdshell.sock` is the
  legacy driver for the launcher / switcher / locker and is still
  needed by the `NN-*.md` scenarios it was authored against. The
  shipping qdshell is Quickshell IPC based: new `agent-*` smokes
  (`agent-click-smoke.sh`, `agent-mvp-session-smoke.sh`,
  `agent-protocol-audit.sh`, `agent-cursor-clickthrough-smoke.sh`) do
  NOT depend on the ctrl-socket. Prefer the new path for new tests;
  port `NN-*.md` scenarios off the ctrl-socket as Quickshell IPC
  hooks land.

## What works (and what doesn't)

| Surface | Driveable how | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Single keys / non-modifier chords | `qdwin_send_key KEY_*` (virsh send-key) | evdev-layer; --holdtime applied; OK for plain typing |
| Real-keyboard chords (Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+L, etc.) | `qdwin_chord <holds> -- <taps>` (QMP `input-send-event`) | **mandatory** for any chord that depends on a modifier-release transition (e.g. weston modifier_binding fires only when modifier was alone — see B3-switcher post-mortem in ) |
| Single key down/up explicitly | `qdwin_qmp_key <qcode> <down\|up>` | building block of qdwin_chord; reach for it when a scenario needs Alt held while doing other work |
| Input to focused **toplevels** | qdwin_send_key or qdwin_chord | foot/firefox/etc. once on screen and focused |
| Launcher overlay text input | **NOT keyboard** — only `qdwin_ctrl "launcher-type ..."` | known §6.8 gap; see `qdshell/Modules/Launcher (QML):17-23` |
| Launcher click-to-select | **NOT mouse** — only `qdwin_ctrl "launcher-activate"` | same gap |
| Locker password input | **NOT keyboard** (variant of launcher gap) — only `qdwin_ctrl "unlock-password <pw>"` | tracked B4 |
| Mouse pointer move | `qdwin_mouse_move <px_x> <px_y>` (QMP `input-send-event` abs axes; helper converts pixels to 0..32767) | toplevels under cursor receive enter events + can request cursor shape |
| Mouse clicks (left/right/middle) | `qdwin_click <x> <y> [button]` or split `qdwin_mouse_button left down\|up` | left-click on a chrome side or content surface raises + focuses the toplevel (click-to-focus, since task(129)) |
| Mouse drag (button held + motion) | `qdwin_drag <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> [button]` | move + down + N intermediate moves + up. Drag of a titlebar (within the N chrome strip, outside the close/min/max buttons) translates the whole toplevel. `QDWIN_DRAG_STEPS`/`QDWIN_DRAG_STEP_MS` tune granularity. |
| Visual assertion | `qdwin_screenshot <file.png>` (wraps virsh screenshot + PPM→PNG) | cursor is on a KMS plane and never appears in the screenshot |

## qcode reference

`qdwin_qmp_key` and `qdwin_chord` take qemu key codes (qcodes), NOT linux KEY_* names. See `qapi/ui.json` `QKeyCode` enum upstream. Common ones:

| qcode | Linux KEY_ |
|---|---|
| `alt`, `alt_r` | LEFTALT, RIGHTALT |
| `ctrl`, `ctrl_r` | LEFTCTRL, RIGHTCTRL |
| `shift`, `shift_r` | LEFTSHIFT, RIGHTSHIFT |
| `meta_l`, `meta_r` (super) | LEFTMETA, RIGHTMETA |
| `tab`, `esc`, `ret`, `spc`, `backspace` | TAB, ESC, ENTER, SPACE, BACKSPACE |
| `a..z`, `0..9`, `f1..f12` | A..Z, 1..0, F1..F12 |
| `left`, `right`, `up`, `down` | LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN |

## Helper script

Source `qdwin-helpers.sh` from any scenario runner:

```bash
source phase1/gui-tests/qdwin/qdwin-helpers.sh
qdwin_set_vm demo-260430-0912
qdwin_session_healthy || { echo "session not up"; exit 2; }

# Plain typing — virsh send-key is fine
qdwin_send_key KEY_LEFTCTRL KEY_SPACE   # or use ctrl-socket directly:
qdwin_ctrl "launcher-type foot"
qdwin_ctrl "launcher-activate"
sleep 1.5
qdwin_screenshot /tmp/foot-running.png

# Alt+Tab / Ctrl+Alt+L — MUST use qdwin_chord (real-keyboard sequence)
qdwin_chord alt -- tab          # one Alt+Tab cycle
qdwin_chord ctrl alt -- l       # lock screen
qdwin_chord alt -- tab tab      # cycle twice while Alt is held
```

### Why two key paths

`virsh send-key`, `qdwin_send_key`, and `qemu-monitor-command 'sendkey'` all press the listed keys simultaneously, hold for `--holdtime`, then release simultaneously. There is no "Alt held alone, Tab released" intermediate state in the resulting evdev stream. weston's `weston_compositor_add_modifier_binding` (used for the original switcher_commit / lock-on-modifier-release patterns) fires *only* when the modifier was pressed *alone* for the entire hold. Press Tab during the Alt-hold and the binding never fires. Verified 2026-04-30 by capturing /dev/input/event0 with evtest while pressing Alt+Tab on a real keyboard: all four events arrived in correct order, but the binding still did not fire.

`qdwin_chord` instead emits each event independently via QMP `input-send-event` (down for each hold key, then down/up for each tap key, then up for each hold key in reverse). Order matches what a real keyboard produces, and weston's grab `modifiers` callback (the new path used by the switcher in qdwin.c) sees the Alt-released transition cleanly.

For non-chord key tests (typing into a focused toplevel, sending Enter, etc.) `qdwin_send_key` is faster and fine.

The helper pushes ctrl-socket payloads through the same host:8765
HTTP server `fresh-vm-bootstrap.sh` uses (so `vm-exec`'s JSON quoting
never sees embedded quotes). Make sure the HTTP server is running
under `compositor/`:

```
cd ${QDWIN_REPO} && \
  python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1 &
```

## Reading screenshots

A vision-capable LLM agent (e.g. Claude with `Read` on a `.png`)
extracts text and shape directly from the framebuffer. For non-vision
agents:

```bash
zypper -n install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-traineddata-english
tesseract /tmp/foo.png - -c tessedit_create_tsv=1
```

yields tab-separated `(text, left, top, width, height)` rows. Match
on text labels, not pixel offsets — qdshell font/theme drift breaks
hard-coded coordinates across clones.

## Hard-learned pitfalls (qdwin-specific)

1. **Launcher cache is built lazily on first toggle and never
   rescanned.** A package installed after the session started won't
   appear in the launcher until qdshell is restarted (or until a
   `launcher-rescan` ctrl command is added — currently a TODO). Add
   any test-only packages to `fresh-vm-bootstrap.sh` so they're
   present before greetd-qdwin starts.

2. **CSD-only toplevels (foot, GTK4 apps without
   server-decoration-v1) double-decorate.** qdshell attaches its own
   chrome + the client also draws a titlebar inside its content area.
   foot specifically logs `"no decoration manager available - using
   CSDs unconditionally"` — the toplevel renders at its CSD-default
   tiny size with both decorations stacked. xdg-decoration-v1 was
   declined per spec/27 (chrome is private-protocol shell-attached);
   tracked as a real gap, not a test-author problem.

3. **Foot launched via the launcher's `setsid Exec=foot --server`
   sometimes exits before chrome attaches; foot launched directly via
   `runuser -u admin -- bash -c 'WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 foot'` stays
   alive.** When a scenario needs a known-good toplevel for input
   tests, prefer the direct path; reserve the launcher path for
   testing the launcher itself.

4. **Don't `systemctl restart greetd-qdwin.service` mid-scenario
   without re-waiting for the ctrl-socket.** The socket disappears
   for 3–5s during restart; a too-quick `qdwin_ctrl` returns
   "Connection refused".

5. **virsh send-key doesn't echo errors** for unknown keysyms — it
   just returns 0 and nothing happens. Stick to `KEY_*` constants
   from `/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h`.

6. **Cursor visibility in `virsh screenshot` depends on the renderer.**
   With `--renderer=pixman` (the VM default) weston falls back to
   compositing the cursor into the primary framebuffer, so it DOES
   show in `virsh screenshot` since task(135). With
   `--renderer=gl` + virgl, weston puts the cursor on the hardware
   cursor plane, which `virsh screenshot` doesn't capture. Don't rely
   on its presence/absence as a robust assertion across renderer
   profiles — assert by-effect for behavioural tests ("after click at
   (X, Y), expected toplevel at the front").

7. **The pre-fixed VMs autologin as the `greeter` pseudo-user (uid
   471), not admin.** If `qdwin_session_healthy` returns false but the
   service is active, check `loginctl list-sessions` — if you see uid
   471 on tty3 you're on a pre-task(125) image. Re-run
   `bootstrap-qdwin-in-vm.sh` against an updated source tree.

## Available scenarios

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `01-open-terminal.md` | end-to-end: launcher → filter → activate → type into focused terminal (B2 + auto-focus + ctrl-socket launcher path) |
| `02-launcher-keyboard.md` | real-keyboard input into launcher overlay — type, arrows, Esc, Enter (B3) |
| `03-locker-cycle.md` | Ctrl+Alt+L → type password → Enter unlock → keyboard reaches focused toplevel again (B1 + B4 + post-unlock regression) |
| `04-alt-tab-switch.md` | Alt+Tab single-press swaps focus + raises + survives close-and-refocus (switcher_grab + anchor + request_raise re-stack + on_toplevel_removed refocus) |
| `05-launcher-rescan.md` | new app installed mid-session appears in launcher on next toggle (B5) |
| `06-mouse-click-focus.md` | clicking a background window's chrome focuses + raises it (mouse path) |
| `07-titlebar-buttons.md` | clicking maximize / restore / minimize glyphs on the titlebar actually changes window state (mouse path) + ctrl-socket control comparison; also verifies maximised window leaves room for chrome + panel (not fullscreen) |
| `08-titlebar-close-button.md` | clicking the red × on the titlebar destroys the toplevel; chrome_button right-click+left-click cycle for the close action |
| `09-titlebar-context-menu.md` | right-click on titlebar opens qdshell context-menu popup; clicking "Restore"/"Maximise" / "Minimise" / "Close" items dispatches the right action via qdwin_shell_v1@v21 popup_button |
| `10-context-menu-relabel.md` | the maximise/restore row label flips with `tl.state & 1` on every menu open ("Maximise" ↔ "Restore"), proving the label is recomputed not cached |
| `12-bar-no-overdraw.md` | bar `content` and `exclusion-top` agree on height; maximized windows do not have their top row clipped by the bar's bottom row (pixel-mismatch fix + `exclusionZoneBleed` toggle round-trip) |
| `13-focus-events-emitted.md` | every keyboard-focus transition between toplevels emits a `qdwin: focus handle=N (was M) seat=…` line, including the spawn / spawn / close-handoff / last-close-to-no-window sequence |
| `14-bar-content-quiet-when-idle.md` | journal grows by ≤2 bar-content remap lines over 10 s idle (no remap storm) and re-settles to quiet after a window cycle |
| `15-keybinding-events.md` | Ctrl+Space / Alt+Tab / Ctrl+Alt+L / registered hotkeys all emit `qdwin: <event>` log lines independent of shell binding state (silent-drop guard) |
| `16-qdshell-binding-protocol-events.md` | qdshell binds qdwin_shell_v1 at v14 via the Qdistro.Qdwin QML plugin; `hello`, `toplevel_added/removed`, `seat_focus_changed`, and switcher_next/commit all round-trip; alt+tab cycles focus via the protocol |
| `17-qdshell-drives-close.md` | qdshell's `Qdwin.closeWindow` Q_INVOKABLE invokes `qdwin_shell_v1.request_close(handle)`; target toplevel exits cleanly and the removal propagates back through the protocol to the QML side |
| `18-workspace-switch.md` | v24 workspaces: switching hides/shows windows across workspaces and the settings count reconciles to the compositor (ext-workspace-v1 + qdshell `workspace` IPC) |
| `19-wm-policy.md` | v25 window-manager-policy qdshell-driven gate: IPC `capabilities` reports `bound=true wmPolicy=true keybindRegistration=true` (WindowManager tab live-apply) + one visual proof a tile resizes the live client. Direct-compositor proof split out to `21-wm-policy-bystander.md` |
| `20-idle-dpms.md` | v26 idle/DPMS: Path A reads the idle/DPMS capability deterministically via qdshell IPC (`idleDpms=true`, journal `idleDpms -> true` fallback); Path B drives `set_display_power` off/on directly via `qdwin-bystander`. Modern `qdshell.service`/`qdwin-compositor.service` contract (legacy `noctalia-*` units retired) |
| `21-wm-policy-bystander.md` | v25 window-manager-policy direct-compositor functional proof (split from 19): `qdwin-bystander` drives `set_wm_policy`/`request_tile` left/right/restore/`request_fullscreen`/`register_hotkey` over its FIFO; all deterministic journal asserts (tiled client resizes, not just chrome) |
| `agent-mvp-session-smoke.sh` | executable agent/CI smoke for plan2 MVP session invariants: qdwin/qdshell active, qdshell bound to qdwin_shell_v1, legacy LXQt/labwc absent, cursor sprites active, Ctrl+Space logged, and ordinary toplevels released from qdwin's holding layer |
| `agent-click-smoke.sh` | executable agent/CI smoke: launches two known test windows, injects QMP mouse clicks, asserts focus moves to the clicked toplevel, and reports the qdshell launcher-icon click as a named gap unless `QDWIN_REQUIRE_LAUNCHER_CLICK=1` is set |
| `agent-protocol-audit.sh` | executable agent/CI audit: records qdwin Wayland globals, scans qdshell's Quickshell/Wayland usage, and checks that opening the qdshell launcher does not hit the xdg-popup null-parent protocol error |
| `agent-cursor-clickthrough-smoke.sh` | plan3 H3: spawns a known xdg-toplevel, parks the pointer over it (so a cursor sprite maps on cursor_layer), and verifies the click still lands on the toplevel. Discriminator: `qdwin: focus handle=N` matches the test window. `QDWIN_CURSOR_CLICKTHROUGH_FORCE_BREAK=1` flips the expectation for validating the regression itself. |
| `agent-cursor-paint-smoke.sh` | **agent-assisted** smoke for the two regressions that make a qdwin desktop unusable: (A) the qdshell crash-loop (version-skewed Qdwin.qml `onOutputsChanged` ↔ qdwin QML plugin — Quickshell exits 255, black scanout) and (B) the missing/doubled VM cursor (virtio-gpu hw cursor plane). Deterministic asserts: noctalia-shell active + bounded NRestarts + no QML "non-existent property" error since the live `qs` PID started + bind ≥ v14; qdshell bar-content layer surface mapped + non-black scanout; DRM `plane-1` crtc=crtc-0 / real fb / "allocated by weston"; cursor sprite mapped on cursor_layer. Then a **vision LLM** reads a post-pointer-move screenshot and confirms `{painted, top_bar, cursor_count}` — expecting 0 software cursors in the scanout (the cursor is on the off-scanout hw plane; >0 ⇒ double-cursor regression). Knobs: `QDWIN_CURSOR_IN_SCANOUT=1` for the pixman/software-cursor profile, `QDWIN_SKIP_AGENT=1` for deterministic-only, `QDWIN_AGENT_CMD` to swap the vision agent, `QDWIN_MAX_RESTARTS`. Self-tested both negatives: a stopped qdshell and an inverted cursor expectation both FAIL. |
| `agent-idle-dpms-recovery-smoke.sh` | executable VM smoke for qdwin internal-idle + qdshell display-power recovery. Requires an ABI-matched qdwin build deployed in the guest. Saves qdshell settings, sets display-off to 1 minute and a safe inactivity action to 2 minutes, keeps pointer motion active past the display-off timeout to assert it does not blank mid-use, waits for a black/inactive scanout, injects real QMP key+mouse input, and asserts a recovered non-black screenshot plus `set_display_power on=0` then `on=1` logs. Also fails if the longer inactivity notification fires at the shorter display-off timeout. Restores original qdshell settings on exit. |

Run each scenario sequentially against the same VM; each cleans up after itself. For a full smoke pass, an orchestrator can spawn one runner per scenario in series.

## Running a scenario

1. Read `qdwin/NN-*.md` top to bottom before acting.
2. Source `qdwin-helpers.sh`.
3. Follow the **Setup** block. Stop and FAIL if any step exits
   nonzero or `qdwin_session_healthy` returns false.
4. Execute **Steps** in order. After each step that mutates state,
   capture a screenshot to `/tmp/<scenario-stem>-<step>.png` AND read
   it (vision) or OCR it before moving to the next step. Don't trust
   the prior step's "ok" — qdshell logs success on dispatch, not on
   completion.
5. For each **Assert**, decide PASS/FAIL by looking at the most
   recent screenshot AND/OR the qdshell `list` snapshot. Report
   concretely: quote the OCR'd text or the snapshot fields.
6. Cleanup: kill spawned processes, ensure the launcher is hidden,
   reset the locker if engaged.
